# Welcome!
This R workshop introduces the `stargazer` package, which makes it easy to create reproducible and beautiful tables from your data and models, especially for publication. I will also discuss solutions to common problems when researchers want to prepare their R data and visualizations for publication.

## Workshop information
The workshop will start on 05/09/2022 at 11am, and will last for about an hour.
- **Required packages:** stargazer, tidyverse
- **Recommended packages:** rticles, bookdown

## LaTeX users
Stargazer really shines in LaTeX, but it's too big of a topic for us to cover in this workshop. I encourage you to paste your stargazer table codes into Overleaf.com, texMaker, or your favorite LaTeX editor. There are a number of LaTeX-specific functions for stargazer to check out, so you can encode header information, alignment specifications, and so on, directly from R.
